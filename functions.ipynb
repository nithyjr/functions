Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","      Parameters:\n","          These are the variables listed inside the parentheses when a function is defined. They act as placeholders for values that are passed into the function.\n","\n","      Arguments:\n","          These are the actual values or data you pass into the function when calling it.\n","      \n","      Example:\n","          def greet(name):  # 'name' is the parameter\n","              print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")        \n","          greet(\"Alice\")  \n","          # \"Alice\" is the argument passed to the 'name' parameter\n","\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","\n","      Defining a function:\n","            A function is defined using the def keyword followed\n","            by the function name, parentheses (with optional parameters), and a colon. The function body follows with an indentation.\n","\n","      Calling a function:\n","            A function is called by using its name followed by parentheses. Arguments are passed inside the parentheses if the function accepts any.\n","\n","      Example:\n","          def say_hello():\n","              print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","          say_hello()\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n","        The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. Without it, the function will return None by default.\n","\n","        Example:\n","          def add(a, b):\n","              return a + b\n","\n","          result = add(2, 3)  # result will be 5\n","\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","      Iterable:\n","          An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. It can be iterated over, but it doesn't necessarily produce values on the fly. Lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries are examples of iterables.\n","\n","      Example:\n","          my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","      Iterator:\n","          An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It keeps track of its current position, and it implements the __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n","          \n","        Example:\n","            my_iter = iter(my_list)\n","            print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 1\n","            print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 2\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","        A generator is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function and the yield keyword instead of return. Generators allow lazy evaluation, meaning they generate values on the fly without storing the entire sequence in memory.\n","\n","      Example:\n","\n","            def count_up_to(n):\n","                count = 1\n","                while count <= n:\n","              yield count\n","              count += 1\n","\n","      gen = count_up_to(5)\n","      for number in gen:\n","          print(number)\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","      Memory Efficiency:\n","          Generators do not store the entire sequence in memory, which makes them much more memory-efficient for large datasets.\n","      Lazy Evaluation:\n","          They generate values on-demand, which can improve performance when dealing with large sequences or infinite sequences.\n","      Cleaner Code:\n","          Generators can often replace complex iterators or recursion with more readable code.\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","\n","      A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression. Lambda functions are typically used for short-lived operations, often passed as arguments to functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().\n","\n","      Example:\n","\n","        add = lambda x, y: x + y\n","        print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n","\n","      The map() function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and returns an iterator (in Python 3) that produces the results.\n","\n","    Example:\n","\n","        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","        squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n","        print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n","\n","10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n","\n","      map():\n","          Applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns an iterator with the results.\n","\n","      Example:\n","\n","        numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n","        doubled = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)\n","\n","      reduce():\n","          Applies a binary function (a function that takes two arguments) cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n","\n","      Example:\n","\n","          from functools import reduce\n","          numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","          product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)  # Output: 24\n","\n","      filter():\n","          Filters elements of an iterable based on a function that returns True or False and returns an iterator with the items that evaluated to True.\n","\n","      Example:\n","\n","          numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","          even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n","          print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4]\n","\n","11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce() function on this given list: [47, 11, 42, 13]\n","        The reduce() function in Python applies a binary function (a function that takes two arguments) cumulatively to the items in an iterable, from left to right, to reduce it to a single value. In this case, we can use it to find the sum of the list.\n","\n","      Example:\n","\n","          from functools import reduce\n","\n","          numbers = [47, 11, 42, 13]\n","\n","          # Define a lambda function to add two numbers\n","          sum_result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n","          print(sum_result)  # Output: 113\n","\n","Step-by-Step Internal Mechanism:\n","\n","The reduce() function starts with the first two elements of the list:\n","\n","47 and 11.\n","\n","47 + 11 = 58\n","The result (58) is then combined with the next element (42).\n","\n","58 + 42 = 100\n","The result (100) is then combined with the next element (13).\n","\n","100 + 13 = 113\n","\n","The final result is 113."],"metadata":{"id":"MC86belixeSX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
